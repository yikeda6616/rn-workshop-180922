# React Native Workshop - 0922

This is a repository for [React Native Workshop](https://github.com/katsumeshi/react-native-workshop-0922)

## Notes

**Expo XDE is deprecated** and superseded by Expo Dev Tools, which is included in **Expo CLI**.

To install Expo Cli,

```
$ npm i -g --unsafe-perm expo-cli
```

### [Get Started With Expo](https://expo.io/learn)

After installed expo-cli,

```
$ expo init my-project
$ cd my-project
$ yarn start (or expo start)
```

### react-navigation v3

[App Containers update](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/app-containers.html#docsNav)

> Note: In v2 and earlier, the containers in React Navigation are automatically provided by the `create\*Navigator` functions. As of v3, you are required to use the container directly. In v3 we also renamed `createNavigationContainer` to `createAppContainer`.
